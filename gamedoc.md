### Summary:
#### Duel is a player vs computer 3d dueling game, in which you battle for coins to spend on better gear, you continuosly fight in rounds until you meet your match and perish in the arena.

### Gameplay:
#### You start at the menu where you can press play and enter the tutorial, in the tutorial basics will be taught like how to attack, block and parry, when the player has completed tutorial they may continue, the player will be met with the prompt "Choose a weapon" and three buttons showcasing a light, medium and heavy weapon. Once the player chooses they will begin their first fight where they utalize the skills taught to them in the tutorial, if they manage to beat their opponent they will get coins and move onto the shop, there they may buy better weapons and armour each with different stats and (depending on if i have enough time) special skills, and thats the loop defeat opponent, get coins, buy better gear and become stronger and beat another stronger opponent until you eventually lose (maybe add an end if i feel like it fits)
